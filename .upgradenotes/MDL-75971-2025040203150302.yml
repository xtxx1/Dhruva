        Behat now supports email content verification using Mailpit.

        You can check the contents of an email using the step `Then the email to "user@example.com" with subject containing "subject" should contain "content".`

        To use this feature:

        1. Ensure that Mailpit is running

        2. Define the following constants in your `config.php`:
            - `TEST_EMAILCATCHER_MAIL_SERVER` - The Mailpit server address (e.g. `0.0.0.0:1025`) 
            - `TEST_EMAILCATCHER_API_SERVER` - The Mailpit API server (qe.g. `http://localhost:8025`)

        3. Ensure that the email catcher is set up using the step `Given an email catcher server is configured`.
